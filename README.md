## Inspiration

As young adults, we should be learning how to manage our money, save, and most importantly budget. We were inspired by mobile apps like Mint where users can input their income and distribute them through the use of categories. We were also inspired by budgeting videos where people are showing themselves budget using pen and paper and wanted to digitalize the process.

## What it does

Budget Buds gives users the ability to choose different types of expenses including Vacation/Travel, Transportation, Emergency Fund, Investments, Health Insurance, Entertainment, Personal Care, and Education. 

## How we built it

We built the application by designing the UI and UX of Budget Buds, we used applications like Mural and Figma. We implemented the project using html5, css3, javascript, and python.

## Challenges we ran into

At first, we had trouble connecting the frontends and backends together. This was because while we were running the Flask application, we were unable to change the templates that we created for the frontend using html5. However, we were able to figure it out with the help and guidance of mentors that assisted us along the way.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

This was one of our teammate's first ever hackathons and we were really excited to work with her! We were amazed at how our team was able to collaborate so well together. Teamwork does make the dream work!

## What we learned

We learned that having a balance between finance and personal care is what really matters. When our team created our own budgeting sheets using our web app: Education, Emergency Fund, and Investments were the most used categories.

## What's next for Budget Buds

We plan on implementing more customization tools for the user experience on the frontend. For example, preference of expenses (what type of expenses they are looking to manage on our platform).
For the backend, we plan on using data collection gathered from the input forms from the frontend to keep track of emails (for newsletters), username and password (for account management).
