## Technica Hackathon 2022
## Budget Buds: Money Management App

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for developing Budget Buds stemmed from the need for young adults to learn effective money management, savings, and budgeting skills. We drew inspiration from popular mobile apps like Mint, which allow users to allocate their income into various categories. Additionally, we were inspired by budgeting videos where individuals showcased their budgeting methods using pen and paper, and we aimed to digitize and enhance that process.


## What it does
Budget Buds empowers users to track and manage their expenses across nine different categories, including Vacation/Travel, Transportation, Emergency Fund, Investments, Health Insurance, Entertainment, Personal Care, and Education.

## How we built it
To bring Budget Buds to life, we utilized design tools like Mural and Figma to create a user-friendly and visually appealing UI and UX. The application itself was developed using a combination of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Python.


## Challenges we ran into
One of the initial challenges we encountered was integrating the frontend and backend components. Specifically, we faced difficulties modifying the templates created with HTML5 for the frontend while running the Flask application. However, with the guidance and support of mentors, we were able to overcome this hurdle and successfully integrate the different aspects of the project.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Particularly, we take pride in the fact that Budget Buds was the first hackathon experience for one of our team members. Witnessing her enthusiasm and growth throughout the project was truly remarkable. Moreover, we are proud of our team's exceptional collaboration and effective teamwork, which greatly contributed to the success of the project.


## What we learned
Throughout the development process, we learned the significance of striking a balance between financial management and personal well-being. As we created and utilized our own budgeting sheets through the Budget Buds web application, we discovered that categories such as Education, Emergency Fund, and Investments were among the most frequently utilized by our team members.

## What's next for Budget Buds
Looking ahead, our future plans for Budget Buds involve enhancing the customization options available to users on the frontend. For instance, we aim to provide users with the ability to personalize their expense preferences and tailor the platform to their specific needs. On the backend, we intend to leverage the data collected from the frontend input forms to implement features such as email collection for newsletters and username/password management for user accounts.
